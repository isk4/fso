## 🛠️ Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite/CRA (depending on the exercise), React Query/Redux (depending on the part)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **DB**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (depending on the part)
- **Testing**: Jest, Testing Library, Cypress, Supertest
- **Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions (depending on the part)

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Node.js (recommended: LTS)
- npm / pnpm / yarn (use whatever is configured per project)
- (Optional) Docker
- (Optional) MongoDB or PostgreSQL depending on the exercise

> If each subproject has its own `package.json`, `cd` into that folder before installing.

## 🚀 How to run an exercise

### 1) Frontend (typical example)
```bash
cd part2/phonebook
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2) Backend (typical example)
```bash
cd part3/phonebook-backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Environment variables (example)

Create a `.env` in the project that needs it:

```env
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
TEST_MONGODB_URI=your_test_mongodb_uri
SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

> Each part/project can require different variables. Check the local README if present, or the code.

---

## 🧪 Tests (project-dependent)

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test
```

E2E (if applicable):

```bash
npm run cypress:open
# or
npm run test:e2e
```

---

## 🧹 Lint / Format

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

---

## 🧭 Repo status

This repo is a work in progress.  
If something doesn’t run “out of the box”, it’s usually due to:
- differences between course/exercise versions
- missing `.env`
- updated dependencies vs. the original material
